# Arrays and Strings in C++

# Experiment 7

## Aim
To study and implement C++ Arrays and Strings

## Theory
Arrays are a colllection of variables containing the same types of datatype, there cannot be an array with different datatypes in C++ programming language.
Arrays have continous memory allocation
For example: -
If an array is of the integer datatype, then: -
1. The array will contain only integer datatype values and variables
2. If the first element memory is allocated at 1000 then the 2nd element
